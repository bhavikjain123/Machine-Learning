# Machine Learning Exploration

## Overview
Welcome to my machine learning playground! ðŸš€ In this journey, I delved into various supervised and unsupervised learning tasks using a variety of datasets and powerful algorithms. Here's a glimpse of the adventures:

## Supervised Learning

### Linear Regression - Sepal Length Prediction
Utilized Linear Regression to predict sepal lengths based on features in a dataset. Evaluated model performance using cross_val_score.

### Housing Prices Prediction
Explored Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso models to predict housing prices using the California Housing dataset. Calculated cross_val_score for each model.

### Logistic Regression - Breast Cancer Prediction
Implemented Logistic Regression for predicting Breast Cancer. Employed grid search to find the best hyperparameters, revealing best_params and best_score.

### Decision Tree Classification
Embarked on a classification journey with Decision Trees, creating captivating visualizations to bring the data to life. ðŸŒ³

## Unsupervised Learning

### Clustering and Performance Metrics
Dove into unsupervised learning, employing Silhouette Coefficient to gauge clustering performance. Leveraged the WCSS and elbow method to find the optimal K value.

### Libraries Used
Throughout this exhilarating ML journey, relied on powerful libraries including scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib.

## Get Started
Feel free to explore the provided notebooks and scripts to dive into each project. Install the required dependencies using:

```bash
